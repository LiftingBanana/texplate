\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap_Intro}
A little introduction to show some cool commands. 
Start with a cool citation \cite{crimgTest}. 
Now present the groundbreaking pseudo algorithm in Algorithm 
\ref{algo_pseudo} from said paper. \\

\begin{algorithm}[h]
	\caption{CCR subroutine}
	\textbf{Input:} 
    number of anime watched $N$.
    
	\textbf{Returns:} 
	Level of cringe.
	
	\textbf{Do:} 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
        Resolve hours of anime $h_{\textrm{tot}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} h_i a_i$, where $h_i$ is the hour-count 
        of the $i$-th anime $a_i$. 
		
        \item
		Return cringe level $L  \overset{R}{\gets}  \exp({h_{\textrm{tot}} })$.
	\end{enumerate}
	\label{algo_pseudo}
\end{algorithm} 
The paper probably contains funky symbols, such as $\pazocal{E}$ and $\cmsy{H}$. 
Maybe there's even some 
$\bm{quantum}$ stuff, like $\bra{\psi}$ and $\ket{\varphi}$. Just \emph{why}, you ask? 
Because everyone thinks it is hip and funky. 
Of course, we have cool code formatting with monokai syntax highlighting, such as for scripts: \\
\begin{minted}{perl}
    #!/bin/bash
    
    echo "Hello, world!"
    >> Hello, world!
\end{minted}
And even for external files, such as this python garbage: \\
\inputminted{python}{codes/test.py}
Aside from that, this being \LaTeX, there is of course a lot of math going on. 
\begin{theo}
	The most cancerous expression I ever had to actually write in a latex file reads
	\begin{align*}
		\restr{g(r)}{\Lambda} \defeq
		\frac{\exp 
			\Big( -\frac{1}{2} r^2 \Big) }{d} \Biggl( 
				\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (-1)^i 
					\underbrace{
					\frac{1}{i! (2i+d)} \left( \frac{r^2}{2}\right)^i
					}_{a_i} 
			\Biggr)^{-1}.
	\end{align*}
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}
	Proof by integration. 
	\begin{align*}
		\int\limits_{\mathrm{my}}^{\mathrm{life}} 
			\text{crippling depression} \; dx = \text{dank memes}.
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}
If you want, you can also wrap figures nicely. And do weird stuff around them. 
% this empty line is needed 

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.38\textwidth]{images/rad_doge.png}
		\caption{This dog is cooler than you.}
		\vspace{-1.5cm} % the space after the lable is a little much, erase some.
		\label{fig_dog}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\noindent Like writing stupid things just to create a bit of a text that wraps around 
a retarded meme of an astonishingly rad looking dog. \\
Don't forget to include sufficiently many line breaks to allow nice formatting. 
Otherwise you're gonna be crying yourself to sleep, I promise. 
I know because I am every night. Anyways, here's another cool list, this time with roman letterings. 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item \textcolor{colordgray}{anime}
	\item \colorbox{colororange}{autism}
	\item \textcolor{colorgreen}{cringe}
\end{enumerate} 
Yeah, you guessed it. It's a list describing my personality. Dont forgot to escape abbreviations such 
as i.e.\ if you want to write nice stuff. Quotes are usually done with either \enquote{enquote} 
or actual ``quotation marks''. Anyways I'm out of words, but the paragraph hopefully 
wrapped the meme by now. In case not, here's another symbol mumbo jumbo goulash from 
measure theory with two neatly aligned equations
\begin{align*}
	X_{\ast} P (A) 
	= P(X^{-1}(A)) 
	&\equiv P_X(A) \equiv P(X \in A)  
	\; \mathrm{for} \; A \in \cmsy{P}(\mathbb{R}^n), \\
	P_Z \Big( \prod_{i=1}^{n} A_i \Big) 
	&= P \Big( 
		\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n X_i^{-1}(A_i) 
		\Big).
\end{align*}
And to fill up the page, this is about the only mathematically relevant thing you might 
need that I can think of -- and haven't mentioned yet -- for now:
\begin{align*}
	P^{\sigma}_{kl} = 
	\begin{cases}
	\sqrt{2} &\quad \text{if } l = \sigma(k)\\
	0 &\quad \text{else}  \\
	\end{cases}
\end{align*} 
\section{The epitome of cringe} \label{sec_cringe}
\subsection{an autobiography} \label{subsec_mylifecringe}
\epigraphfontsize{\small\itshape}
\epigraph{``Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."}
{--- \textup{Some cringy ass Mofo}}
Now you also know how to quote something. In case you want to shoe everyone 
how pretentious and annoying you are. And yes, I actually used this, go figure. 
This (my life) doesn't deserve an extra chapter, but this is how you create one. 
And you can reference Chapter \ref{chap_Intro}. Or the cool Figure \ref{fig_dog}.
If you need to give an example of how autistic you are, you may use the following.
\par\noindent\rule[-15pt]{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
\begin{ex} \label{ex_endme}
	Yeah. I won't hand out stories of my life, but we all know how it is. 
	\begin{align*}
		\mathop{\Scale[2]{\prod}}_{
			x \sumel \mathrm{mylife} \times \mathbb{Z}_2
			} 
		x^2
		= \mathrm{cringe}
	\end{align*}
	And give it another cool bar to separate it probably from the rest 
	of your super cool and interesting prose.
